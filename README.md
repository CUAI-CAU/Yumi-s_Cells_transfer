## Abstract
> GAN is hard to training model with less datasets. Also, it takes many time. <br/>
> There are many pre-trained model with famous and large datasets ( FFHQ, AFHQ, CelebA-HQ ... ). However, in reality, it is very difficult to collect good datasets of interest.<br/>
> We trained small datasets with popular Webtoon 'Yumi's Cells'. Then, We generated Cells' images and compared various stylegan models.
